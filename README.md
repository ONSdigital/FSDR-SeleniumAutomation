## Selenium Junit Template with Gradle or Maven as build tools

To automate [Selenium Webdriver](https://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) binaries management in runtime am using [webdrivermanager](https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager), an excellent library by [Boni GarcÃ­a](https://github.com/bonigarcia) 

### How to run?
Clone or download and issue the below commands in project root directory
 
 ##### Gradle
```javascript
gradle test
```
By default it runs in Chrome browser, you can specify which browser to use as well
```javascript
gradle test -Dbrowser=firefox
```
Currently supported browsers are 
* chrome
* firefox
* edge
* ie
* opera 

##### Maven
```javascript
mvn test
```
Or
```javascript
mvn test -Dbrowser=firefox
```
